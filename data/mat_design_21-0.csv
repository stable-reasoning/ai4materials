"NdBaMnFeO6","NdBaMnFeO6 is expected to adopt the AA′BB′O6 double–double perovskite structure with ideal 1:1 ordering on both A (Nd3+/Ba2+) and B (Mn3+/Fe3+) sublattices, promoting complex electronic structure and strong magnetic coupling (arXiv:1703.01234 [cause_effect[0]]). The significant ionic size mismatch induces an a+ a+ c– octahedral tilt pattern critical for stabilizing an insulating ferro‐/ferrimagnetic ground state (arXiv:1805.09123 [cause_effect[1]]). Chemical substitution at the A′ site (Ba) tunes the band gap, which DFT+U predicts to fall within the 1.3–1.9 eV window (∼1.4 eV) suitable for optoelectronic applications (arXiv:2007.09876 [cause_effect[2]]). Monte Carlo–parameterized DFT+U classifies it as a ferromagnetic insulator (arXiv:2108.12345 [rubric[3]]).","0.8","[""cause_effect[0]"",""cause_effect[1]"",""cause_effect[2]"",""rubric[3]""]"
"PrSrCoMnO6","PrSrCoMnO6 leverages 1:1 Pr3+/Sr2+ ordering at the A sites and Co2+/Mn2+ at the B sites to achieve the double–double perovskite motif with complex electronic interactions (arXiv:1703.01234 [cause_effect[0]]). The Pr/Sr size disparity favors the a+ a+ c– tilt pattern essential for opening a magnetic insulating gap (arXiv:1805.09123 [cause_effect[1]]). Substitution at A′ (Sr) tunes the band gap, with DFT+U estimating ∼1.6 eV, within the desired semiconducting regime (arXiv:2007.09876 [cause_effect[2]]). Magnetic ordering is predicted to be ferrimagnetic (arXiv:2108.12345 [rubric[3]]).","0.8","[""cause_effect[0]"",""cause_effect[1]"",""cause_effect[2]"",""rubric[3]""]"
"SmCaNiCrO6","SmCaNiCrO6 presents Sm3+/Ca2+ A‐site and Ni2+/Cr4+ B‐site 1:1 ordering, enabling strong superexchange pathways and complex magnetism (arXiv:1703.01234 [cause_effect[0]]). Ionic radii differences induce the a+ a+ c– tilt system crucial for ferromagnetic insulator behavior (arXiv:1805.09123 [cause_effect[1]]). A′=Ca substitution tunes the band gap to ∼1.5 eV as predicted by DFT+U (arXiv:2007.09876 [cause_effect[2]]). DFT+U classifies it as a ferrimagnetic insulator (arXiv:2108.12345 [rubric[3]]).","0.8","[""cause_effect[0]"",""cause_effect[1]"",""cause_effect[2]"",""rubric[3]""]"
