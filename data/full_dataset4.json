    "gold_answer": "no",
    "gold_trace": "Clusters 1 and 2 exhibit nonlinear time‐dependence governed by exponent c; dropping c would fail to model their curvature.\nremove exponent c → model reduces to linear+proportional\nclusters 1&2 → require nonlinear exponent to fit\nsimplified model → fails clusters 1&2"

    "gold_trace": "A log‐likelihood difference of only 1 yields AIC/BIC differences <2, which is not considered decisive evidence.\nlog‐likelihood difference small (≈1) → ΔAIC/BIC small\nΔAIC/BIC < 2 → no strong model preference\ncannot decisively favor Weibull"

Would the pressure predictions at that distance remain valid under the semi‐infinite elastic half‐space approximation?",
    "gold_answer": "no",
    "gold_trace": "Distances below the minimum contact radius fall inside the contact area, where the semi-infinite half‐space solution is not applicable.\nr=50 nm < a_min (~80 nm) → inside contact region\ninside contact region → half-space formula invalid\npressure prediction → not physically valid"

    "gold_answer": "yes",
    "gold_trace": "Contact radius a_c ∝ tan(half‐angle); a smaller half‐angle yields a smaller tan and thus a smaller a_c.\nhalf‐angle ↓ → tan(half‐angle) ↓\ntan(half‐angle) ∝ a_c\na_c ↓ at constant depth"

    "gold_answer": "uncertain",
    "gold_trace": "Using only one feature may reduce separation power and the number of identifiable clusters could change.\nremove hardness feature → feature space dimensionality ↓\nreduced dimensionality → cluster separation weaker\ncluster count outcome → uncertain"

    "question": "Imagine that in the Type 0 (no holding) tests a microplastic event during unloading led to a 5% underestimation of elastic work. Would this single‐test error undermine the conclusion that elastic energy contributions are essentially constant across all holding times?",
    "gold_answer": "yes",
    "gold_trace": "An underestimation in one group would introduce a systematic bias, making the comparison across holding times unreliable.\nmicroplastic event → elastic work underestimated\nunderestimation in Type 0 → ratio differences emerge\nconstant‐across‐times conclusion → compromised"

    "gold_trace": "A higher standard deviation at 30 s would indicate variability depends on holding time, not solely spatial heterogeneity.\nhardness_std(30s) > hardness_std(0s) → variability changes with time\ntime‐dependent variability → spatial heterogeneity explanation incomplete"
