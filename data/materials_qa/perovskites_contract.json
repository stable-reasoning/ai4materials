Omitting the vertex breaks this cause-effect link, so the absence of divergence is an artefact of the approximation, not a failure of the hypothesis.

    "pred_trace": "Contract 10-4 expects that, when properly computed (i.e. including the full vertex), a divergence in the multipolar (here quadrupolar) susceptibility should signal hidden order. In this case, the approximate treatment using only χ₀ fails to show a divergence, even though resonant x-ray scattering confirms quadrupolar order. This discrepancy is attributable to the approximation, not to a failure of the underlying contract. Thus, despite the numerical deficiency caused by neglecting the full vertex, the contract remains mostly compatible with the physical reality (rated around 0.8).",
