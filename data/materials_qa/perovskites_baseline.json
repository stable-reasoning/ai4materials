    "gold_trace": "Contract 10-4 relies on solving the full Bethe–Salpeter equation including the vertex to capture the critical divergence.  Omitting the vertex breaks this cause-effect link, so the absence of divergence is an artefact of the approximation, not a failure of the hypothesis.  Consistency is therefore reduced but not zero.\nfull vertex inclusion → accurate χ_K(q)\ndivergence of χ_2 → predicts quadrupolar order\nvertex neglected → divergence suppressed\nexperiment shows quadrupolar order → calculation incomplete",
    "pred_answer": "0.8",
    "pred_trace": "Although the approximated susceptibility using χ₀ (i.e. with the vertex neglected) fails to show a divergence, resonant x–ray scattering confirms quadrupolar order below 25 K. This implies that the full vertex, as required by contract 10-4 to reveal the divergence, is essential. The hidden order exists as predicted, and the failure to see divergence in the approximation does not contradict the contract’s physical picture.",
