If γ is chosen to be 0.1 eV but the on-site exchange splitting is ~0.3 eV, would the penalty energy contribution be negligible at convergence?",
    "gold_answer": "no",
    "gold_trace": "γ=0.1 eV is smaller than the 0.3 eV exchange, so the penalty term would still compete and not be negligible.\nPenalty energy ∝γ\nγ < exchange splitting → penalty non-negligible"
