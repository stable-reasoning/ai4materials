    "question": "In the variance‐constrained semi-grand canonical (VC-SGC) ensemble used for the hybrid MD+MC of Cu46Zr46Al8, the variance parameter κ was set to 10^3. If one were to increase κ to 10^4 while keeping all other settings identical, would the ensemble still strictly maintain a fixed total number of particles (N) and a fixed volume (V)? Answer yes, no, or uncertain.",
    "gold_answer": "yes",
    "gold_trace": "The ensemble definition (VC-SGC) enforces fixed N and V by construction; κ only tunes concentration fluctuations, not particle count or volume.\nDefinition of VC-SGC ensemble -> fixed N and V irrespective of κ\nκ parameter -> controls variance in concentration only"

If the cooling rate were increased to 10^14 K/s (others equal), would the hybrid MD+MC algorithm still remain equilibrated below T_g≈713 K? Answer yes, no, or uncertain.",
