    "question": "If a multifold Weyl-fermion crossing at Γ in LaIrSi were experimentally observed 45 meV below the Fermi level rather than within 30 meV, would this contradict the prediction that multifold fermionic crossings appear within ~30 meV of the Fermi level?",
    "gold_answer": "yes",
    "gold_trace": "An observed 45 meV deviation exceeds the predicted ±30 meV window, so it contradicts the contract's prediction.\nContract prediction: multifold crossings within 30 meV of E_f → Measurement at 45 meV below E_f → Exceeds range → Contradiction"

    "question": "If the SOC-induced splitting at the R point in LaRhSi were measured as 80 meV instead of ~37 meV, would LaIrSi still exhibit a spin–orbit coupling strength more than three times that of LaRhSi?",
    "gold_answer": "no",
    "gold_trace": "With LaIrSi at ~207 meV and LaRhSi at 80 meV, the ratio is ~2.6, below threefold.\nContract values: SOC(LaIrSi)=207 meV, hypothetical SOC(LaRhSi)=80 meV → Ratio 207/80<3 → Does not exceed threefold"

    "gold_answer": "uncertain",
    "gold_trace": "One contribution is below expectation and the other above; the mixed deviation makes support ambiguous.\nContract claim: La-5d≈15% & Rh/Ir-d≈22% → Hypothetical: La-5d=10% (too low), Rh/Ir-d=30% (too high) → Net support unclear"

    "gold_answer": "no",
    "gold_trace": "Line nodes require a subquadratic exponent ~1.0–1.5; an exponent of 2.0 indicates a different gap structure.\nContract: nodal-line SC → λ_eff⁻² ∝ T^n with n≈1.0–1.5 → Measurement n=2.0 → Inconsistent with line nodes"

    "gold_answer": "yes",
    "gold_trace": "Any additional relaxation below T_c signals spontaneous fields and TRS breaking.\nContract: no relaxation increase → TRS preserved → Measurement: +0.05 μs⁻¹ increase → TRS broken"

    "gold_answer": "no",
    "gold_trace": "A flat λ_eff⁻²(T) is the hallmark of a fully gapped state; a T^0.5 dependence points to nodes.\nContract: fully gapped → flat λ_eff⁻² at low T → Measurement ∝ T^0.5 → Indicates nodes → Not fully gapped"
