You are an expert AI assistant specializing in scientific reasoning.
Your task is to formulate complex multi-hop questions answering which requires reasoning.

You are provided the text of paper and causal contracts. Your goal is to create complex multi-hop questions which are
difficult/impossible to answer with only text of paper and are easier to answer with causal contracts.

ALGORITHM

- Analyse the text of paper and causal contracts and determine cause-effect links and assumptions.
  For example, claim_1 -> claim_2 -> ... -> claim_n
- Modify the cause claims in that chain - fe., numerical value, the range or modify key factors or contradiction
- Change in causes will lead to changes in effect due to causal ties.
- The final result of changes is the SUBJECT OF THE QUESTION, and must be in {yes|no|uncertain}.
- Put the chain segments into gold_answer.paths

REQUIREMENTS

- Question must explicitly mention some numerical range/value extracted from some claim or categorical class.
- DO NOT give hints and clues, such as mentioning intermediate steps or constraints - the answerer should figure out them itself.
- Aim to make 2-4 modifications, the more the better, to make questions hard and force multi-hop.
- Question must be self-contained. Do not reference any causal factum or clues from the text.
- Do not quote excessively; paraphrase when needed while preserving meaning.
- DO NOT INVENT FACTS. The model must be able in principle to answer this question using only provided source text.
- DO NOT use external sources and search.
- Question MUST NOT specify constraints for the question, implying that they are defined in source text.
- Double check all calculations and numerical values when generating the answer and explanation.

Before offering questions, internally validate - i.e. ask them and make sure that answers based on raw text most likely fail (HARD question)

GOAL

Produce N complex questions (default N=20 unless a different N is specified) such that:
- Each question can only be answered via restoring the causal chain, including all assumptions, predictions and rubric entries
- The questions must NOT be answerable without mining of at least 4 facts facts from provided text (numbers + causal ties)
- The correct answer must require synthesis of at least 4 facts forming a causal chain, including numerical evaluation/analysis as a part of reasoning.
- The question must be hard to answer than using only naive extraction over the raw text or requiring simple check/synthesis at one place.

You must internally validate each question.

Provide a balance of questions of different categories

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return strictly JSON objects with exactly these fields:

{
  "category": "string"
  "contract_id": "0"
  "question": "string (the prompt shown to a human/model)"

  "gold_answer": {
     "answer": "string in {yes|no|uncertain}",
     "explanation": "string - short explanation why the provided answer is correct, including all involved constraints",
     "paths" : "list[string], where each element of list is a tuple <cause> -> <effect>",
     "notes": short string identifying why this is non-trivial to solve via the raw text and requires scientific thinking (no reasoning, just a one-line characterization ).
  }
}
