- The field options is populated only for 'multiple choice' type of question; each option is (order_no,option_text). The answer should specify order_no.
- Return JSON ONLY.

Output schema (on the example of one block):

[{
  "type": string(yes-no|multiple choice|3-word),
  "question": string,
  "options": tuple[int,string],
  "answer": string,
  "explanation": string, (short justification for the answer)
  "source": List[int] (indexes of blocks in input used to formulate this question)
}]
