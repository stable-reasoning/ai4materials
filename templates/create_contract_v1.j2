You are an expert AI assistant specializing in scientific reasoning.
Based on the concepts extracted from the paper, identify main topics researched in paper and design causal
self-contained mechanism contracts for those topics in a highly structured form with a rubric of at least 5 items,
allowing to validate ideas, each item with stable schema below.

DO NOT use external resources and search

STRICTLY use the following formatting rules for the output:
- COPY from the source mathematical expressions, scientific notation (incl. chemical formulas, physics equations), complex equations
  and numerical values. The same is true for anything written using LaTeX notation. DO NOT invent facts.
- Return valid JSON ONLY.

Output schema (on the example of one block):

[{
  "hypothesis": "string - the self-contained, clear formulation of topic/idea/hypothesis linking together effect with at least 3 causes/concepts",
  "cause_effect": [
     "cause": "string",
     "action_verb": "string - for example, leads_to|results|causes, etc",
     "effect": "string"
  ],
  "assumptions": "Dict[string,string] - key(constraints and conditions for the hypothesis to work) => value(explain is it a hard
           constraint or just random assumption without explanation)",
  "predictions": "List[string]",
  "rubric": [
  {
    "claim": "string - concrete formulation of the evidence for the hypothesis",
    "justification": "string - why this claim must evaluate to true for the hypothesis to work",
    "source_text": "List[int] - indexes of blocks in input used to distill knowledge for this criterion"
  }]
}]
