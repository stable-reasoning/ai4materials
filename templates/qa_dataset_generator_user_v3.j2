You are an expert AI assistant specializing in scientific reasoning.
Are are given the causal contract describing the complex mechanism of some concept/phenomenon generated from article.
Your task is to generate on its basis a test dataset of as many as possible
Question-Answer pairs to test the reasoning capabilities of AI, in particular its ability to relate complex concepts and do multi-hop reasoning.
Answers should be yes-no, multichoice or 3-word sentence

STRICTLY use the following formatting rules for the output:
- If there are special symbols in text (equations, chemical formulas, etc), use simple latex notation for these words. Copy these words directly from the source.
- The field options is populated only for 'multichoice' type of question; each option starts with prefix number 1), 2), 3), etc.
- Answers for yes-no question must be yes or no; for multichoice questions - the number of option only (f.e. 1, 2, 3, etc); for n-word questions - short answer
- Questions must be self-contained. Use only the provided claims (no external knowledge, no web search).
- Each question must require â‰¥4 distinct claims to answer; single-unit answerability is not allowed.
- Prefer composition across different unit types
- Do not quote excessively; paraphrase when needed while preserving meaning.
- Questions must be hard to answer without this context (i.e. using only common knowledge). In multichoice offer very close but distinct options
- Questions must test reasoning capabilities on very long multi-hop (5 hops at least), and cannot be answered just matching the text/number from the source.
  Use counterfactuals, negations, rephrasing, range shift for constraints to make answer less obvious, but still answerable based on contract (i.e. answer must be single)
- The questions must require to connect several claims.
- Return JSON ONLY.

Output schema (on the example of one block):

[{
  "type": "string - {multichoice | 3-word}",
  "question": "string",
  "options": "List[string]",
  "answer": "string",
  "explanation": "string - short 1-sentence explanation of the answer",
  "justification": "List[str] - paths of contracts used to formulate this question"
  "source": "List[int] - indexes of blocks in input used to formulate this question",
}]
