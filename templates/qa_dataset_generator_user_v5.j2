We want to show that using causal CONTRACTS like the one below (contract_5.json) improves reasoning capabilities
in the sense that allow to answer MORE COMPLEX questions, that just using RAW_TEXT from the parsed paper (ie. rec_5.json).

ALGORITHM

1) Analyse the hypothesis in contract and determine which causal links and assumptions are linked to it.
2) Modify the claims from conditions/assumptions/rubric/cause_effect, to make contradictions, overlapping or inclusion.
This modification can be a change in range or different quantitative conditions.
Question must explicitly mention some numerical range/value extracted from some claim or categorical class.
3) Question must be self-contained, don't rely on contract. Do not reference any causal factum from the contract.
The model must be able in principle to answer this question using only provided source text of paper or using internalized knowledge only (closed book).

Before offering questions, internally validate - i.e. ask them and make sure that answers based on raw text most likely mostly fail

GOAL

Produce N complex questions (default N=12 unless a different N is specified) such that:
Each question can be answered easy using the causal contract (because the required causal chain, assumptions, predictions,
or rubric entries are explicit there), but hard for naive extractive QA over the raw text (because facts are scattered, implicit, or require multi-hop synthesis).
You must internally validate each question.

QUESTION TYPES (mix across these; ensure diversity)

Generate a balanced set spanning at least 4 categories; no category should exceed 40% of items.

Counterfactual / assumption stress-test
Perturb a key assumption (e.g., break limit, adjust range), generate a self-contained question from the hypothesis, with possible answers in {yes|no|uncertain} and short explanation why.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Return strictly JSON objects with exactly these fields:

{
  "category": "string - one of {counterfactual}"
  "contract_id": "string - copy from contract"
  "question": "string (the prompt shown to a human/model), the answer should be {yes|no|uncertain}. Must be solvable purely from the contract + text (no hidden reasoning)."

  "gold_answer": {

     "answer": "string from {yes|no|uncertain}",
     "explanation": "string - short explanation why the provided answer is correct",
     "paths" : "list of CoT summaries in free text like { <cause> -> <effect>}",
     "triples": "list of triples {subject: str, relation: str, object: str}",
     "numeric_ranges": "List of { name: str, min: num, max: num, units: str } - optional, to enforce the expected range and untis we want to see in answer",
     "notes": short string identifying why this is trivial via the contract but non-trivial via the raw text (no reasoning, just a one-line characterization ).
  }
}
